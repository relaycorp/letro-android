# Letro for Android

[Letro](https://letro.app/en) is a service like email, but end-to-end encrypted, spam-free, phishing-free and works without the Internet too -- all thanks to [Awala](https://awala.network)!

## Architecture

Here, we are using MVVM with Hilt dependency injection

## Contributing

We love contributions! If you haven't contributed to a Relaycorp project before, please take a minute to [read our guidelines](https://github.com/relaycorp/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

Please note that we're not accepting translations just yet as the copy is likely to change radically until the UX is independently assessed, which will happen at some point before making the app generally available. We're just trying to be mindful of your time and ours! Once the copy reaches a relatively stable state, we'll want to translate the app into as many languages as possible, so stay tuned.
